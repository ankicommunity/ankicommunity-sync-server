[Anki][] is a powerful open source flashcard application, which helps you
quickly and easily memorize facts over the long term utilizing a spaced
repetition algorithm. Anki's main form is a desktop application (for Windows,
Linux and macOS) which can sync to a web version (AnkiWeb) and mobile
versions for Android and iOS.

This is a personal Anki server, which you can sync against instead of
AnkiWeb. It was originally developed by [David Snopek](https://github.com/dsnopek)
to support the flashcard functionality on Bibliobird, a web application for
language learning.

This version is a fork of [jdoe0/ankisyncd](https://github.com/jdoe0/ankisyncd).
It supports Python 3 and Anki 2.1.

Installing
----------

1. Install the dependencies:

        $ pip install -r src/requirements.txt

2. Modify ankisyncd.conf according to your needs

3. Create user:

        $ ./ankisyncctl.py adduser <username>

4. Setup a proxy to unchunk the requests.

    Webob does not support the header "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" used by Anki
    and therefore ankisyncd sees chunked requests as empty. To solve this problem
    setup Nginx (or any other webserver of your choice) and configure it to
    "unchunk" the requests for ankisyncd.

    For example, if you use Nginx  on the same machine as ankisyncd, you first
    have to change the port in `ankisyncd.conf` to something other than `27701`.
    Then configure Nginx to listen on port `27701` and forward the unchunked
    requests to ankisyncd.

    An example configuration with ankisyncd running on the same machine as Nginx
    and listening on port `27702` may look like:

    ```
    server {
        listen      27701;
        server_name default;

        location / {
            proxy_http_version 1.0;
            proxy_pass         http://localhost:27702/;
        }
    }
    ```

5. Run ankisyncd:

        $ python -m ankisyncd

Installing (Docker)
-------------------

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/ankicommunity/anki-devops-services#about-this-docker-image).

Setting up Anki
---------------

### Anki 2.1.28 and above

Create a new directory in [the add-ons folder][addons21] (name it something
like ankisyncd), create a file named `__init__.py` containing the code below
and put it in the `ankisyncd` directory.

    import os

    addr = "http://127.0.0.1:27701/" # put your server address here
    os.environ["SYNC_ENDPOINT"] = addr + "sync/"
    os.environ["SYNC_ENDPOINT_MEDIA"] = addr + "msync/"
#### anki 2.1.41-2.1.43
this short message is temprarily useful while upload function bug is not fixed.
After creating a new profile and entering it,fist,Add a card whose contents or notes are casual.
Second,Hit sync button and choose download from ankiweb (not upload).
After that,you can freely enjoy edit cards and syncing .may 

### Anki 2.1

Create a new directory in [the add-ons folder][addons21] (name it something
like ankisyncd), create a file named `__init__.py` containing the code below
and put it in the `ankisyncd` directory.

    import anki.sync, anki.hooks, aqt

    addr = "http://127.0.0.1:27701/" # put your server address here
    anki.sync.SYNC_BASE = "%s" + addr
    def resetHostNum():
        aqt.mw.pm.profile['hostNum'] = None
    anki.hooks.addHook("profileLoaded", resetHostNum)

### Anki 2.0

Create a file (name it something like ankisyncd.py) containing the code below
and put it in `~/Anki/addons`.

    import anki.sync

    addr = "http://127.0.0.1:27701/" # put your server address here
    anki.sync.SYNC_BASE = addr
    anki.sync.SYNC_MEDIA_BASE = addr + "msync/"

### AnkiDroid

Advanced â†’ Custom sync server

Unless you have set up a reverse proxy to handle encrypted connections, use
`http` as the protocol. The port will be either the default, 27701, or
whatever you have specified in `ankisyncd.conf` (or, if using a reverse proxy,
whatever port you configured to accept the front-end connection).

Use the same base url for both the `Sync url` and the `Media sync url`, but append `/msync` to
the `Media sync url`. Do **not** append `/sync` to the `Sync url`.

Even though the AnkiDroid interface will request an email address, this is not
required; it will simply be the username you configured with `ankisyncctl.py
adduser`.

Development
-----------

### Testing

0. Prerequites

This project uses [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to simplify the development commands. It also uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage the Python dependencies. Ensure they are installed.

1. Create a config for your local environment.

```bash
$ cp config/.env.example config/.env.local
```

See [ENVVAR configuration overrides](#envvar-configuration-overrides) for more information.

2. Download Python dependencies.

```bash
$ make init
```

3. Run unit tests.

```bash
$ make tests
```

ENVVAR configuration overrides
------------------------------

Configuration values can be set via environment variables using `ANKISYNCD_` prepended
to the uppercase form of the configuration value. E.g. the environment variable,
`ANKISYNCD_AUTH_DB_PATH` will set the configuration value `auth_db_path`

Environment variables override the values set in the `ankisyncd.conf`.

Support for other database backends
-----------------------------------

sqlite3 is used by default for user data, authentication and session persistence.

`ankisyncd` supports loading classes defined via config that manage most
persistence requirements (the media DB and files are being worked on). All that is
required is to extend one of the existing manager classes and then reference those
classes in the config file. See ankisyncd.conf for example config.
